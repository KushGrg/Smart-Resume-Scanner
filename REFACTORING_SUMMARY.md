# Smart Resume Scanner – Refactoring & Feature Integration Summary

## 🎯 Project Overview
The Smart Resume Scanner is a Laravel + Livewire application for automated resume ranking and professional resume building. It uses a custom TF-IDF algorithm with cosine similarity for AI-powered candidate-job matching, and provides a multi-step resume builder with PDF export. The system is fully role-based (Job Seeker, HR, Admin, Super Admin) and follows modern Laravel best practices.

### 4. TF-IDF Resume Ranking & Processing System (Issue #6)
- Implemented core TF-IDF algorithm with cosine similarity in `app/Services/ResumeRanker.php`
- Advanced text preprocessing: tokenization, stopword removal, stemming
- Multi-format resume text extraction (PDF, DOC, DOCX)
- Asynchronous queue jobs for text extraction and similarity calculation
- Batch processing and CLI management via `php artisan resumes:process`
- Scores stored in `resumes.similarity_score` for HR dashboard ranking
- Robust error handling and retry logic for failed jobs

### 5. Resume Builder & PDF Export (Issue #22)
- Multi-step resume builder for job seekers (profile, education, experience, skills)
- PDF resume generation using DomPDF
- Specialized models for each resume section
- Enhanced CreateProfile Livewire component and updated routes
- All new tables and models fully integrated with existing system
- Backward compatibility: all core features and ranking preserved

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

### 1. Install Dependencies
```bash
composer install
npm install
```

### 2. Set Up Environment
Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update database and mail settings as needed.
```bash
cp .env.example .env
php artisan key:generate
```

### 3. Run Migrations & Seeders
```bash
php artisan migrate --seed
```
This sets up all tables, roles, permissions, and demo users.

### 4. Start the Application (All Services)
```bash
composer dev
```
This runs the Laravel server, queue worker, log monitor, and Vite dev server concurrently.


### 5. Resume Processing (Automatic & Manual)
Resume processing and ranking is handled **automatically** whenever a resume is uploaded or updated, thanks to model observers and queue jobs. No manual action is required for normal operation.

You can also manually trigger batch processing or reprocessing if needed:
```bash
php artisan resumes:process --all
```
Or process for a specific job post:
```bash
php artisan resumes:process --job-post=1
```

### 6. Quality Assurance (Lint, Format, Static Analysis)
```bash
composer qa       # Run all quality checks
composer qa:fix   # Auto-fix formatting issues
composer lint     # Coding standards
composer stan     # Static analysis
composer pint     # Format code
```

### 7. Enable Git Hooks (Recommended)
```bash
composer setup-hooks
# Or manually:
git config core.hooksPath .githooks
chmod +x .githooks/pre-commit
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- **Database Query Optimization:**
  - Created `JobQueryService` for optimized queries
  - Implemented proper eager loading to prevent N+1 queries
  - Added query result caching with configurable TTL
  - Created batch processing methods

- **Database Indexing:**
  - Added composite indexes for frequently queried columns
  - Created full-text search indexes (MySQL/PostgreSQL compatible)
  - Added foreign key indexes for better join performance
  - SQLite compatibility maintained

// After: Optimized with caching and eager loading
$this->jobQueryService->getJobPostsWithResumes(
    search: $this->search,
    perPage: $this->perPage,
    status: 'active'
);
```

### Error Handling Enhancement
```php
// Before: Basic error handling
public function submitApplication() {
    $path = $this->resume->store('resumes', 'public');
    // Create resume record...
}

// After: Comprehensive error handling
public function submitApplication() {
    try {
        // Validation and processing...
        $this->toast(type: 'success', title: 'Application Submitted');
    } catch (TextExtractionException $e) {
        Log::error('Resume processing failed', $e->context());
        $this->toast(type: 'error', title: 'Resume Processing Failed');
    }
}
```

## 📊 Database Performance Indexes Added

```sql
-- Job Posts Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_job_posts_status_created ON job_posts(status, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_job_posts_status_location ON job_posts(status, location);

-- Resume Processing Performance  
CREATE INDEX idx_resumes_jpostid_score ON resumes(jpostid, similarity_score);
CREATE INDEX idx_resumes_processed_score ON resumes(processed, similarity_score);

-- User Relationship Performance
CREATE INDEX idx_job_seeker_details_jid ON job_seeker_details(jid);
CREATE INDEX idx_hr_details_hid ON hr_details(hid);
```
