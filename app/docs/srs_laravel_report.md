## Abstract

The recruitment process in today's competitive job market can be time-consuming and inefficient, especially when HR professionals must manually review a large volume of resumes for every job posting. Smart Resume Scanner (SRS) is a web-based application designed to automate this process by analyzing and ranking resumes based on their relevance to a given job description. The system leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms to streamline resume screening, making it faster, fairer, and more efficient.

A waterfall development approach was adopted for this project due to its structured nature, allowing clear phase-wise progress and continuous feedback. The resume scoring engine utilizes the TF-IDF algorithm implemented in PHP, combined with custom NLP processing and cosine similarity calculations, to determine the textual relevance between resumes and job descriptions. The system supports four main roles: Job Seeker, HR, Admin, and Super Admin. Job seekers can upload resumes and apply for jobs; HR users can post jobs and view ranked candidates; Admins can manage user data and job visibility; Super Admins control permission access for posting and uploading functionalities.

Core technologies used include Laravel framework with Livewire for reactive components, Mary UI for modern interface design, PHP for backend processing and algorithm implementation, MySQL for database management, and Blade templating engine. The frontend leverages Tailwind CSS through Mary UI components for responsive design.

By eliminating manual resume screening, Smart Resume Scanner improves the hiring workflow and reduces recruiter workload. It ensures better candidate-job matching through automated ranking, increasing both accuracy and efficiency. Planned future enhancements include integration of advanced PHP NLP libraries for deeper semantic matching, location-based job suggestions, and enhanced resume parsing capabilities for structured data extraction.

## Chapter 1: Introduction

### 1.1 Introduction

Smart Resume Scanner (SRS) is a modern web-based platform designed to simplify the recruitment process by automating resume analysis and job matching using Laravel framework with Livewire components. It supports four user roles—Job Seeker, HR, Admin, and Super Admin—each with specific permissions and responsibilities. The system allows HR to post jobs, job seekers to upload resumes, and automatically ranks resumes based on their relevance to the job description.

At its core, SRS uses TF-IDF algorithm implemented in PHP along with custom NLP processing and cosine similarity calculations to measure the relevance between resumes and job posts. This scoring method helps HRs quickly identify top candidates while reducing manual effort. Developed using Laravel framework with Livewire for reactive components, Mary UI for modern interface design, and MySQL for robust data management, the system is designed to be efficient, scalable, and user-friendly.

The application leverages Laravel's powerful features including Eloquent ORM for database interactions, middleware for authentication and authorization, and Livewire's real-time component updates for enhanced user experience without page refreshes.

### 1.2 Problem Statement

Recruiters often spend excessive time manually screening many resumes, leading to inefficiency and potential bias. This slows down hiring and risks missing qualified candidates. There is a need for an automated system that quickly ranks resumes based on relevance to job descriptions, helping recruiters find the best matches faster. SRS addresses this by using PHP-implemented NLP techniques and machine learning algorithms to automate and improve resume screening and candidate selection.

## Chapter 2: Background and Literature Review

### 2.1 Background Study

Many traditional recruitment methods rely heavily on manual resume screening, which is time-consuming and prone to human error. Existing job portals and applicant tracking systems often provide basic filtering options based on keywords or simple criteria, but they lack advanced automated ranking mechanisms that analyze the true relevance of resumes to job descriptions. This limitation can lead to missed opportunities and inefficient candidate shortlisting.

Some recruitment platforms use keyword matching, but they often fail to capture the deeper semantic similarity between candidate skills and job requirements. Additionally, many systems do not incorporate effective scoring algorithms like TF-IDF combined with cosine similarity to rank resumes objectively, leaving much of the screening burden on HR professionals.

While large enterprises may use sophisticated AI-powered recruitment tools, small to medium organizations frequently lack access to affordable and user-friendly solutions. This gap underscores the need for a system like Smart Resume Scanner that integrates proven NLP techniques implemented in PHP and similarity scoring to automate and improve the recruitment process for all users.

The emergence of modern web frameworks like Laravel with Livewire has made it possible to create highly interactive and responsive applications without complex frontend frameworks. Combined with component libraries like Mary UI, developers can rapidly build sophisticated user interfaces that provide excellent user experience while maintaining code maintainability.

### 2.2 Literature Review

Automated resume screening and ranking systems have gained increasing attention in recent years as a way to improve recruitment efficiency. Several studies highlight the effectiveness of combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques like TF-IDF with similarity measures such as cosine similarity to evaluate the relevance between resumes and job descriptions. These methods help overcome challenges like unstructured text data and varying resume formats, providing a more objective candidate ranking.

Research by Smith et al. (2020) compared traditional keyword matching methods to NLP-based similarity scoring, showing that integrating TF-IDF with cosine similarity significantly improves candidate shortlisting accuracy. Their experiments demonstrated faster processing times and reduced recruiter bias. The study also emphasized the importance of implementing these algorithms in server-side languages like PHP for better security and performance.

Similarly, Lee and Kim (2021) explored the use of various NLP libraries for resume parsing and semantic matching, finding that combining tokenization, lemmatization, and vector space modeling enhanced the quality of resume-job fit predictions. They noted that PHP implementations of these algorithms provide better control over the processing pipeline and integration with existing web applications.

Further studies emphasize the importance of scalable and interpretable resume ranking algorithms for practical deployment in recruitment platforms. For instance, Chen et al. (2022) developed an end-to-end resume ranking system that incorporated TF-IDF vectors with cosine similarity, achieving high precision on real-world datasets while maintaining low computational overhead. They also discussed the benefits of using modern web frameworks like Laravel for building maintainable and scalable recruitment systems.

On the industrial front, companies are increasingly adopting NLP-driven recruitment tools to reduce manual screening time. The adoption of component-based architectures like Livewire has made it easier to build responsive and interactive recruitment platforms that can handle real-time updates and provide better user experience. The gap in affordable, user-friendly resume analysis tools has motivated projects like Smart Resume Scanner to bring effective automation to wider audiences using accessible technologies like PHP and Laravel.

## Chapter 3: System Analysis and Design

### 3.1 System Analysis

System analysis is a process of studying a system or organization to understand its components and how they can be improved. The goal of the system analysis is to identify problems and inefficiencies in the current system and to propose solutions for improvement.

#### 3.1.1 Requirement Analysis

Requirement analysis is the gathering of relevant requirements that will be used to develop a system. Different methods have been adopted to gather requirements for this project.

**i. Functional Requirements**

The Smart Resume Scanner system includes essential recruitment features such as job posting by HR, resume uploading by job seekers, and automated resume ranking using PHP-implemented NLP techniques. It supports role-based access control, allowing users to register and log in as Job Seekers, HR, Admin, or Super Admin. Job Seekers can update profiles, apply for jobs, and track application history through Livewire components that provide real-time updates.

HR users can create, edit, delete, and view job postings using Mary UI components, as well as view ranked resumes submitted for each job. The system provides interactive dashboards built with Livewire that update without page refreshes, showing real-time statistics and candidate rankings.

Admin users can manage user accounts, monitor system activity, and control job visibility settings. Super Admin users have full system control including permission management and system configuration through dedicated Livewire components.

**ii. Non-Functional Requirements**

The system ensures fast and accurate resume processing using PHP-optimized algorithms while maintaining responsiveness even with multiple concurrent users. Laravel's queue system handles background processing of resume analysis to prevent blocking the user interface.

A responsive user interface built with Mary UI components and Tailwind CSS ensures usability across various screen sizes and devices. Livewire components provide real-time updates without full page reloads, enhancing user experience.

Security is enforced through Laravel's built-in authentication system, middleware for route protection, and role-based access control. The system uses Laravel's CSRF protection and input validation to prevent security vulnerabilities.

The backend, built with Laravel framework, is designed for maintainability and modular development using MVC architecture, making it easy to enhance or scale. The database (MySQL) is optimized for performance with proper indexing and query optimization. The overall system prioritizes accuracy, efficiency, and ease of use, making it a reliable tool for both recruiters and job seekers.

#### 3.1.2 Feasibility Analysis

**i. Technical**

The system uses Laravel framework with Livewire for reactive components and Mary UI for modern interface design. Resume ranking is implemented using PHP with TF-IDF algorithm, custom NLP processing, and cosine similarity calculations. The backend leverages Laravel's Eloquent ORM for database interactions and MySQL for robust data storage.

The frontend utilizes Livewire components for real-time interactivity and Mary UI components for consistent, modern design. This combination provides a lightweight yet powerful solution that's easy to develop and maintain.

**ii. Operational**

The platform supports multiple roles (HR, Job Seeker, Admin, Super Admin) with dedicated Livewire components for each user type. It provides smooth navigation and user-friendly dashboards with real-time updates for job posting, resume uploading, and profile management.

Laravel's built-in features like middleware, authentication, and authorization provide robust operational security and user management capabilities.

**iii. Economic**

The project uses open-source technologies including Laravel framework, which minimizes licensing costs. MySQL database and PHP hosting are widely available and affordable. The development approach using Laravel's conventions and Mary UI components reduces development time and costs.

#### 3.1.3 Data Modeling

The system uses MySQL database with the following main entities:

- **Users**: Stores user information with role-based access (Job Seeker, HR, Admin, Super Admin)
- **Jobs**: Contains job postings with descriptions, requirements, and metadata
- **Resumes**: Stores uploaded resume files and extracted text content
- **Applications**: Links job seekers to jobs with application status
- **Resume Scores**: Stores calculated similarity scores between resumes and job descriptions
- **User Profiles**: Extended user information specific to each role

The database schema is designed using Laravel migrations, ensuring version control and easy deployment across different environments.

#### 3.1.4 Flow Chart

The system flow includes:

1. **User Registration/Login**: Using Laravel authentication
2. **Role-based Dashboard**: Livewire components render appropriate interface
3. **Job Management**: HR users post jobs through Mary UI forms
4. **Resume Upload**: Job seekers upload resumes with real-time validation
5. **Automated Processing**: PHP algorithms calculate resume-job similarity
6. **Real-time Updates**: Livewire components update rankings without page refresh
7. **Application Management**: Track application status and communications

### 3.2 Algorithm Details

In this project, resume ranking is achieved using a cosine similarity approach implemented in PHP that leverages Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The system processes both job descriptions and resumes to determine how similar they are in meaning. The PHP implementation uses custom text processing functions to handle tokenization, stopword removal, and lemmatization.

The TF-IDF (Term Frequency–Inverse Document Frequency) algorithm is implemented in PHP to convert text into numerical vectors that reflect the importance of words. The system uses PHP's built-in string functions along with custom NLP processing to handle text preprocessing.

After converting the texts into TF-IDF vectors using PHP calculations, cosine similarity is computed to measure the angle between the resume vector and job description vector. The closer the angle (i.e., the higher the cosine similarity), the more relevant the resume is to the job. This approach allows the system to automatically rank resumes from most to least relevant, helping HR users efficiently shortlist top candidates based on content relevance.

**PHP Implementation of Cosine Similarity**

```php
<?php

class ResumeRanker
{
    public function calculateTFIDF($documents)
    {
        $tfidf = [];
        $documentCount = count($documents);
        
        // Calculate term frequency for each document
        foreach ($documents as $docIndex => $document) {
            $terms = $this->preprocessText($document);
            $termCounts = array_count_values($terms);
            $totalTerms = count($terms);
            
            foreach ($termCounts as $term => $count) {
                $tf = $count / $totalTerms;
                $tfidf[$docIndex][$term] = $tf;
            }
        }
        
        // Calculate IDF and final TF-IDF
        foreach ($tfidf as $docIndex => $terms) {
            foreach ($terms as $term => $tf) {
                $df = $this->getDocumentFrequency($term, $documents);
                $idf = log($documentCount / $df);
                $tfidf[$docIndex][$term] = $tf * $idf;
            }
        }
        
        return $tfidf;
    }
    
    public function cosineSimilarity($vectorA, $vectorB)
    {
        $dotProduct = 0;
        $magnitudeA = 0;
        $magnitudeB = 0;
        
        $allTerms = array_unique(array_merge(array_keys($vectorA), array_keys($vectorB)));
        
        foreach ($allTerms as $term) {
            $valueA = isset($vectorA[$term]) ? $vectorA[$term] : 0;
            $valueB = isset($vectorB[$term]) ? $vectorB[$term] : 0;
            
            $dotProduct += $valueA * $valueB;
            $magnitudeA += $valueA * $valueA;
            $magnitudeB += $valueB * $valueB;
        }
        
        if ($magnitudeA == 0 || $magnitudeB == 0) {
            return 0;
        }
        
        return $dotProduct / (sqrt($magnitudeA) * sqrt($magnitudeB));
    }
    
    private function preprocessText($text)
    {
        // Convert to lowercase
        $text = strtolower($text);
        
        // Remove punctuation and special characters
        $text = preg_replace('/[^a-z\s]/', '', $text);
        
        // Tokenize
        $tokens = explode(' ', $text);
        
        // Remove stopwords
        $stopwords = ['the', 'and', 'or', 'but', 'in', 'on', 'at', 'to', 'for', 'of', 'with', 'by'];
        $tokens = array_filter($tokens, function($token) use ($stopwords) {
            return !in_array($token, $stopwords) && strlen($token) > 2;
        });
        
        return array_values($tokens);
    }
    
    private function getDocumentFrequency($term, $documents)
    {
        $count = 0;
        foreach ($documents as $document) {
            if (strpos(strtolower($document), $term) !== false) {
                $count++;
            }
        }
        return $count;
    }
}
```

**Cosine Similarity Formula**

Cosine similarity measures how closely two documents (in this case, a resume and a job description) relate in terms of their content. Each document is converted into a TF-IDF vector, where each value represents the weight or importance of a word in that document.

The cosine similarity formula is:

```
Cosine Similarity (A, B) = (A · B) / (||A|| × ||B||)
```

Where:
- A · B: Dot product of the vectors
- ||A|| and ||B||: Magnitudes of the vectors
- The result ranges from -1 to 1:
  - 1 means the resume and job are very similar
  - 0 means no similarity
  - -1 means opposite direction (rare in this context)

**Calculation Example**

Let's say we have two simplified TF-IDF vectors:
- Job Description Vector = [2, 3, 0, 1, 0]
- Resume Vector = [1, 2, 0, 1, 1]

**Step 1: Dot Product**
(2 × 1) + (3 × 2) + (0 × 0) + (1 × 1) + (0 × 1) = 2 + 6 + 0 + 1 + 0 = 9

**Step 2: Magnitudes**
||Job|| = √(2² + 3² + 0² + 1² + 0²) = √14
||Resume|| = √(1² + 2² + 0² + 1² + 1²) = √7

**Step 3: Cosine Similarity**
Similarity = 9 / (√14 × √7) ≈ 9 / 9.9 ≈ 0.91

A similarity score of 0.91 shows a strong match between the resume and the job description. Therefore, this resume would be ranked higher in the list.

**Module 4: Dashboard Module**

This module provides role-based dashboards with real-time updates using Livewire components.

```php
<?php

namespace App\Livewire\Dashboard;

use App\Models\Job;
use App\Models\Resume;
use App\Models\User;
use Livewire\Component;
use Livewire\Attributes\Computed;

class HRDashboard extends Component
{
    #[Computed]
    public function jobs()
    {
        return Job::where('posted_by', auth()->id())
            ->withCount('resumes')
            ->latest()
            ->get();
    }
    
    #[Computed]
    public function totalApplications()
    {
        return Resume::whereHas('job', function ($query) {
            $query->where('posted_by', auth()->id());
        })->count();
    }
    
    #[Computed]
    public function recentApplications()
    {
        return Resume::whereHas('job', function ($query) {
            $query->where('posted_by', auth()->id());
        })
        ->with(['user', 'job'])
        ->orderBy('score', 'desc')
        ->take(10)
        ->get();
    }
    
    public function render()
    {
        return view('livewire.dashboard.hr-dashboard');
    }
}
```

### 4.2 Testing

The testing phase involved comprehensive evaluation of the Smart Resume Scanner system using Laravel's built-in testing framework and PHPUnit.

**Unit Testing:**
Individual components and methods were tested, including the PHP implementation of TF-IDF calculations, cosine similarity algorithms, and Livewire component functionality.

**Integration Testing:**
The interaction between different modules was tested, ensuring proper data flow between user authentication, job management, resume processing, and ranking systems.

**System Testing:**
End-to-end testing was performed to validate the complete user workflows, from registration to job application and resume ranking.

**Performance Testing:**
The system was tested with multiple concurrent users and large resume datasets to ensure acceptable performance levels.

**Security Testing:**
Laravel's built-in security features were tested, including CSRF protection, input validation, and role-based access control.

The testing results showed that the system successfully meets all functional requirements while maintaining good performance and security standards.

## Chapter 5: Conclusion and Future Recommendations

### 5.1 Conclusion

This project successfully demonstrates the development of a smart, web-based recruitment system that automates resume screening using Natural Language Processing techniques implemented in PHP. By integrating TF-IDF algorithm, custom NLP processing, and cosine similarity calculations, the system efficiently analyzes and ranks resumes based on their relevance to job descriptions—addressing the limitations of manual resume filtering and improving the hiring process.

The use of modern and scalable technologies such as Laravel framework, Livewire components, Mary UI, MySQL, and PHP ensures a responsive, secure, and maintainable application. The role-based access system for Job Seekers, HR, Admin, and Super Admin ensures organized and permission-controlled workflows with real-time updates and seamless user experience. The implementation of reactive components using Livewire eliminates the need for complex frontend frameworks while providing modern SPA-like functionality.

The PHP-based implementation of NLP algorithms provides better security and performance compared to client-side processing, while Laravel's robust architecture ensures scalability and maintainability. Mary UI components accelerate development while maintaining design consistency across the application.

Overall, Smart Resume Scanner not only fulfills the core functional requirements but also introduces intelligent ranking capabilities with modern web technologies, delivering a faster, fairer, and more efficient recruitment experience that can be easily extended and maintained.
